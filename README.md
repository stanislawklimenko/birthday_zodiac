# Birthday and Zodiac Sign Calculator

This project is a simple Python program that takes the user's birthdate and the current date as input, and then calculates the remaining days until their next birthday and their zodiac sign. It also provides information on how to run the program and the prerequisites for the same.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3
An integrated development environment (IDE) or a text editor
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
Run the birthday_zodiac_calculator.py file.
```

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system, you can use the following steps:

### Break down into end to end tests

The end to end tests check the functionality of the entire system. 

```
For example, you can input known birthdates and verify that the program returns the correct remaining days until the next birthday.
```

### And coding style tests

Coding style tests ensure that the code follows the PEP 8 style guide. 

```
You can use tools like flake8 or pylint to run these tests.
```

## Deployment

To deploy this on a live system, you can create an executable file using tools like pyinstaller. This will allow users to run the program without needing to install Python on their machines.
